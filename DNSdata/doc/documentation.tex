%  Thorn documentation in the latex file doc/documentation.tex 
%  will be included in ThornGuides built with the Cactus make system.
%  The scripts employed by the make system automatically include 
%  pages about variables, parameters and scheduling parsed from the 
%  relevent thorn CCL files.
%  
%  This template contains guidelines which help to assure that your     
%  documentation will be correctly added to ThornGuides. More 
%  information is available in the Cactus UsersGuide.
%                                                    
%  Guidelines:
%   - Do not change anything before the line
%       % BEGIN CACTUS THORNGUIDE",
%     except for filling in the title, author, date etc. fields.
%   - You can define your own macros are OK, but they must appear after
%     the BEGIN CACTUS THORNGUIDE line, and do not redefine standard 
%     latex commands.
%   - To avoid name clashes with other thorns, 'labels', 'citations', 
%     'references', and 'image' names should conform to the following 
%     convention:          
%       ARRANGEMENT_THORN_LABEL
%     For example, an image wave.eps in the arrangement CactusWave and 
%     thorn WaveToyC should be renamed to CactusWave_WaveToyC_wave.eps
%   - Graphics should only be included using the graphix package. 
%     More specifically, with the "includegraphics" command. Do
%     not specify any graphic file extensions in your .tex file. This 
%     will allow us (later) to create a PDF version of the ThornGuide
%     via pdflatex. |
%   - References should be included with the latex "bibitem" command.  
%   - For the benefit of our Perl scripts, and for future extensions, 
%     please use simple latex.     
%
% *======================================================================* 
% 
% Example of including a graphic image:
%    \begin{figure}[ht]
% 	\begin{center}
%    	   \includegraphics[width=6cm]{/home/runner/work/tests/tests/arrangements/CactusNumerical/LocalInterp/doc/MyArrangement_MyThorn_MyFigure}
% 	\end{center}
% 	\caption{Illustration of this and that}
% 	\label{MyArrangement_MyThorn_MyLabel}
%    \end{figure}
%
% Example of using a label:
%   \label{MyArrangement_MyThorn_MyLabel}
%
% Example of a citation:
%    \cite{MyArrangement_MyThorn_Author99}
%
% Example of including a reference
%   \bibitem{MyArrangement_MyThorn_Author99}
%   {J. Author, {\em The Title of the Book, Journal, or periodical}, 1 (1999), 
%   1--16. {\tt http://www.nowhere.com/}}

\section{Introduction}

To initiate the simulations of Binary Neutron Stars, one needs realistic initial data that accurately encodes the state of both stars in orbit prior to merger. The numerical code, SGRID, allows the generation of initial data for stars characterized by arbitrary masses, spins, and orbital eccentricities, along with an equation of state.

SGRID is a separate numerical code that can create initial data. To do this, it has to be compiled and run separately from Cactus. On the other hand, this initial data can be used by Cactus to conduct a time-dependent simulation. However, SGRID writes ID files in its own format. To make it usable for Cactus, it is necessary to provide this data on the grid points used by Cactus. This is achieved by interpolating data from SGRID's grid points onto the grid points used by Cactus. The functions that perform the actual interpolation reside inside the SGRID library, which is usually compiled into Cactus by adding the thorn ExternalLibraries-SGRID.

To simplify this process, we have developed a Cactus thorn called DNSdata, which can read SGRID initial data into Cactus, allowing Cactus to perform the subsequent evolution.

Storage can either last for the duration of the run ({\bf Always} means that if this thorn is activated storage will be assigned, {\bf Conditional} means that if this thorn is activated storage will be assigned for the duration of the run if some condition is met), or can be turned on for the duration of a schedule function.
