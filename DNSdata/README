1. Purpose

Import Sgrid's DNSdata, which is binary neutron star initial data.

2. How it works

In order to interpolate Sgrid's DNSdata onto the grid of Cactus, one needs a Sgrid numerical code to be compiled as a library. This library must be linked during the Cactus compilation. The procedure is described in an accompanying REDME.md file in points 2. and 3. which say:

*********** an extract from REDME.md ***********
*
*   2. Set the right path to the Sgrid library in your dns.cfg file. It probably supposed to be
*   "LIBDIRS = path_to_this_project/sgrid/lib", and then the library itself:
*   "LIBS = sgrid"
*
*   3. Go to Cactus directory and compile it using ll_comp.sh or by typing:
*   "./simfactory/bin/sim setup-silent"
*   "./simfactory/bin/sim build -j12 --thornlist ../dns.th --optionlist ../dns.cfg"
*
***********************************************

In order to read Sgrid-generated initial data and make them ready for interpolation, the correct path to the ID directory must be provided. The procedure is described in an accompanying REDME.md file in point 4. which says:

*********** an extract from REDME.md ***********
*
*   4. Set the right path to the Sgrid-generated initial data directory in dns.par file:
*   "DNSdata::sgrid_datadir = "path_to_ID_directory" ",
*   and then build the skeleton of the run by typing:
*   "./simfactory/bin/sim create-run name_of_the_run --parfile ../dns.par"
*
***********************************************

It is worth to mention that the standard sgrid ID packet contains a file, BNSdata_properties.txt. This file is useful to get to know about the model's parameters. Some of them are required by cactus and should be correctly passed to it by setting them in .par file. Among others there are:

a) The center of the grid box in Cactus, "CarpetRegrid2::position_x_1" should correspond to the NS's density maximum, "xmax1" in Cactus-genereted "BNSdata_properties.txt",
b) The parameters related to the choice of the equation of state, "EOS_Omni::poly_K", xxx, yyy, should correspond to the Sgrid's eos parameters listed as: "n_list", "rho0_list", and "kappa" in Cactus-genereted "BNSdata_properties.txt".

One also needs to specify things like:

ActiveThorns = "BNSdata"
HydroBase::initial_hydro         = "BNSdata"
ADMBase::initial_data            = "BNSdata"
ADMBase::initial_lapse           = "BNSdata"
ADMBase::initial_shift           = "zero"
ADMBase::initial_dtlapse         = "BNSdata"
ADMBase::initial_dtshift         = "zero"

Communication between Sgrid and Cactus is achieved via files written into out_dir.
