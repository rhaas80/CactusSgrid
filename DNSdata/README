1. Purpose.

This thorn allows one to use SGRID-generated initial data (ID) of Binary
Neutron Stars (BNS) as a starting point for the Cactus simulation.


2. How does it work?

SGRID is a separate numerical code that can create ID for BNS. In order to
create ID flies, SGRID has to be compiled and run separately from Cactus.
SGRID then writes ID files in its own format. In order to make SGRID's ID
usable for Cactus, it is necessary to provide this data on the grid points
used by Cactus. This is achieved by interpolating data from SGRID's grid
points onto the grid points used by Cactus. The functions that perform the
actual interpolation reside inside the SGRID library, which is usually
compiled into Cactus by adding the thorn ExternalLibraries-SGRID.

In practice, this process requires "two steps" of communication:

Cactus <---> DNSdata <---> SGRID library. 

This thorn is this "intermediate step".


3. How to do it in practice?

In order to read SGRID-generated initial data and make them ready for
interpolation, the correct path to the ID directory must be provided. It
requires the following variable in the parfile:

DNSdata::sgrid_datadir = "<path_to_ID_directory>"

The standard SGRID ID packet is composed of three files:
a) "checkpoint.0"
   -contains the SGIRD ID
b) "xxx.par"
   -is SGRID's own parameter file
c) "BNSdata_properties.txt"
   -contains essential system characteristics that summarize the model

After the first initial stage of the run, when the SGRID interpolation is
completed, the rest belongs solely to Cactus and is independent on the
choice of ID delivery, in particular it is independent on this thorn.


4. Other useful information

Since some system characteristic are required by Cactus and should be
correctly set in Cactus' .par file, it is recommended to get familiar with
"BNSdata_properties.txt" file. Among others there are:

a) Ensure that the center of the grid box in Cactus, specified by
"CarpetRegrid2::position_x_1," corresponds to the density maximum of the
neutron star (NS), denoted as "xmax1" in the SGRID-generated
"BNSdata_properties.txt" file. IMPORTANT COMMENT about unequal mass
binaries: SGRID uses coordinates where the origin of the coordinate system
is at the point halfway between the two stars, whereas Cactus prefers
coordinates where the origin is at the center of mass of the binary. The
DNSdata thorn will translate the stars accordingly, but the user must
understand where the stars then lie and should adjust the Cactus grid
centers accordingly. I.e. "xmax1" in "BNSdata_properties.txt" needs to be
shifted by the CM location "x_CM" to obtain the x-coordinate in Cactus.

b) Ensure that the parameters related to the choice of the equation of state
(EoS) align with SGRID's EoS parameters. SGRID's EoS is described in the
file "BNSdata_properties.txt". For a piecewise polytrope the relevant lines
are indicated by "rho0_list", "n_list", and "kappa". Here "rho0_list"
specifies the rest mass densities at which we switch between polytropes.
"n_list" gives the polytropic index n for each piece. Note that
   Gamma = 1 + 1/n    and    P = K rho0^Gamma.
"kappa" specifies the K of the polytrope used for the lowest density.

c) Additionally, it is necessary to specify the following:

ActiveThorns = "DNSdata"
HydroBase::initial_hydro         = "DNSdata"
ADMBase::initial_data            = "DNSdata"
ADMBase::initial_lapse           = "DNSdata"
ADMBase::initial_shift           = "zero"
ADMBase::initial_dtlapse         = "DNSdata"
ADMBase::initial_dtshift         = "zero"
