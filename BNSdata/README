1. Purpose

Import Sgrid's BNSdata, which is binary neutron star initial data.


2. How it works

In order to interpolate Sgrid's BNSdata onto the grid of Cactus, we need
an Sgrid executable, and Sgrid data. The location of the executable and
the data are set by the pars BNSdata::sgrid_exe and BNSdata::sgrid_datadir
in the Cactus par file. E.g.:
BNSdata::sgrid_exe = "/home/wolf/sgrid/exe/sgrid"
BNSdata::sgrid_datadir = "K123m01.625b12.1irr5dsp0_new_24"

One also needs to specify things like:
ActiveThorns = "BNSdata"
HydroBase::initial_hydro         = "BNSdata"
ADMBase::initial_data            = "BNSdata"
ADMBase::initial_lapse           = "BNSdata"
ADMBase::initial_shift           = "zero"
ADMBase::initial_dtlapse         = "BNSdata"
ADMBase::initial_dtshift         = "zero"

When Cactus starts, each MPI process will start an Sgrid executable,
which in turn will interplate data on Cactus' grid, reading data from
BNSdata::sgrid_datadir. Communication between Sgrid and Cactus is achieved
via files written into out_dir.
