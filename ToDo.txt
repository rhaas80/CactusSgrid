Stuff to fix in DNSdata:
------------------------

useful_files:
*there are a lot of typos in doc (even MyConfog)
*there are grammar errors in doc
*there are strange file names 

*sgrid parfile says "This should be very close to BAM:0113 from there CoRe
 DB.". I wonder if that is true. 
 Is BAM:0113 equal mass (m0=1.504) and 0 spin?

*why is there the empty dir DNSdata_test in test ???

*cactus test parfile should turn on 1d- or 0d-output for
 g_ij, K_ij, rho, press, eps, vel

*in "Numerical Implementation" documentation.tex talks about the sgrid code
 Why? I thought the documentation is supposed to discuss our thorn?
 It's not bad to mention sgrid, but I wonder if this is the right place...

*Can we not have mess???
