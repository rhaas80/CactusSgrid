Stuff to fix in DNSdata:
------------------------

*why is useful_files not in DNSdata?
*there are a lot of typos in doc (even MyConfog)
*there are grammar errors in doc
*there are strange file names 
*README is not very readable on Github because it runs beyond 80 cols!

*README says:
ActiveThorns = "BNSdata"
HydroBase::initial_hydro         = "BNSdata"
ADMBase::initial_data            = "BNSdata"
ADMBase::initial_lapse           = "BNSdata"
ADMBase::initial_shift           = "zero"
ADMBase::initial_dtlapse         = "BNSdata"
ADMBase::initial_dtshift         = "zero"
 Really BNSdata??? 
*What is actually in the parfiles Michal is running?

*test contains the sgrid parfile named just test (bad name), also what if the
 cactus test tries to run it?

*I think it may be much more reasonable to have a dir e.g. m01.5_test inside
 the current test dir that contains
BNSdata_properties.txt  checkpoint.0   m01.5_test.par
 here m01.5_test.par is the sgrid par file that you called test.par ...
 Then et.par can be renamed to something reasonable as well, e.g. test.par or
 something that cactus wants.

*cactus parfile (et.par) talks about Meudon data!
*sgrid parfile says "This should be very close to BAM:0113 from there CoRe
 DB.". I wonder if that is true. 
 Is BAM:0113 equal mass (m0=1.504) and 0 spin?
